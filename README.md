This is an example of implementing media queries on a webpage. 
Whichever screen that the page is viewed on, the content will 
arrange itself appropriately for a phone screen, tablet, or 
computer screen. 

Do not fact check me on the content. The screen sizing function is 
what is important. 
This project is an assignment from Coding Dojo web fundamentals.
